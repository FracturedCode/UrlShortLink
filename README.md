# UrlShortLink
UrlShortLink. My small project trying to reinvent the wheel with a multithreaded tls server in c++. It's supposed to be a dumb url shortening service.
I'm just adding this to show off. Some commit on one of these branches works, I just don't remember which one. If you can't figure it out, it shouldn't be too difficult to debug. Or just try reverse commit until it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
